        // async means it will start doenloading js file in background and as file is downloaded it will execute it 
        // defer means it will download javascript in background and load html and css and then it will after its loaded then js will execute 

        // for eg 
        // we have one js file added in head tag with async so it will start downloading that file in background 
        // but if that file is downloaded when page is loading then it will immidialy stop that and load first js file so it creates this issue 
        // so if we use defer then it will download it in background and then it will run all other files and atlast it will run that js file
